\arguments{
\item{object}{SPARKS object}

\item{event_type}{either SE, A3SS, A5SS}

\item{as_events}{AS events of interest}

\item{event_anno}{Junction information - KnownJC, NovelJC, NovelSS - option to limit}

\item{all_events}{Background + Foreground AS events to limit the scope of the analysis}

Result df in 5 columns - "pval", "odds_ratio", "peak_count", "RBP", "Region"

\description{
This function performs test for enrichment in CLIP peaks in all regions combined.
Unlike the other function, it considers the peak if it is in any of the regions in splicing area.
The function includes "event_anno" to define AS event junction type, whether
known AS events or novel combination of junctions or novel splice sites.
Also this function supports background setting via all_events.
